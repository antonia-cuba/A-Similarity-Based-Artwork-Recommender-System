This artwork presents a nature landscape. The general vibe it gives off is dark. The sky is dark, the main colors are grey, blue, reddish, some white clouds.

The land in the lower side takes most of the painting space. One can notice a cereal field with a path in the middle, which seems to be for agriculture/farming tractors or cars, vehicles. The field is not straigth, the terrain is a bit hilly. The yellow shade on the field can represent cereals, while the greenish is grass, or other type of cereals. The reddish part might be some kind of flowers, grass. In the distance the hills are black, maybe because of the very dark sky.

This scenery is definetlly after rain or storm, because of the shade of the clouds. Judging by the presence of yellow cereals, the season could be summer. So the rain might be a summer storm.

The path goes through the field, extending in the back till the black hills.

There is a lot of grey, blue, greenish.
