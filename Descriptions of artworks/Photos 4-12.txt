This drawing presents a tree in nature. There are many hills in the background. The tree is dry on the bottom branches, but full of leaves on the upper side. A cloud is on top of the tree. The wind seems to be blowing away the leaaves on the base branches.

The colors are black and greenish. The illustration is made in an Asian, Japanese style. The hills and the stripes on them, as well as the curly shape of the flying leaves, remind of this aspect.
