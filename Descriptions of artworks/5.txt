This painting presents a simple nature landscape. The colors are grey, purple, greenish, yellow, and black.

The focus of the artwork is the couple taking a walk with their dog. The are walking on greenish grass, on a field. The dog is following the man and the woman. They are close to eachother, so they can be a couple.

The sky occupies most part of the picture. It is mainly grey, the clouds are dark grey, but also white, light grey. The weather seems to be rainy. One can also notice yellow clouds in the middle, that can symbolise a sunset.

Between the greenish field and grey sky, there is a little water, maybe a lake or river. The purple-grey sky and golden sunset is reflecting on the water.

The vibes of the artwork are dark, because of the amount of grey and purple of the clouds.

The man, woman, and dog are taking a walk on rainy weather.
