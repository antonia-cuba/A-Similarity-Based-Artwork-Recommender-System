The picture presents a nature landscape. The sky takes the majority of the image, while the lower part consists of the representation of water, maybe the sea or a lake.

The sky is mirrored in the water. The sky is cloudy, looks like after rain or a summer storm. The clouds have blue color, dark blue, as well as light blue. There are also yellow and orange clouds, reminding of the sunset hour. The sun is setting.

The water has some dark blue spots.
