This artwork illustrates elements from architecture, but also religion.
One can see a man going up a ladder and carrying some objects, maybe bricks for the tower in construction. He is the builder, construction worker. On the bottom of the building there are construction tools.
On top of the tower, there is an angel with a book in its hand and pointing to a star in the sky.

The image is in black and white. The background is all black, it might be night.

This piece of art depicts both architectural and religious aspects.
One can see a man carrying some items, possibly bricks for the tower that is being built, as he climbs a ladder. He works in construction and is a constructor. Construction equipment is located on the ground level of the structure.
An angel holding a book and pointing to a star in the sky is perched atop the tower.

The picture is monochrome. It might be night because the background is completely black.
