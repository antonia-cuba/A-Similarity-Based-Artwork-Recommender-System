In this artwork, a tree, which is depicted in a reddish hue, represents a component of nature. Squares with letters are hung from the tree's branches. Near the image's top is a cloud as well, but it is still a part of the tree.

The branches in this drawing are really intricate. Reddish is the only used.

On top of the cloud, the branches start having leaves.
