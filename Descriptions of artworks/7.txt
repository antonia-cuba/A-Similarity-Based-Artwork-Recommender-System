This picture is a nature landscape. The general vibe is dark. The colors used are dark and light blue, dark greenish. The majority of the space is occupied by the sky, which is dark. The blue, almost black clouds remind of an after rain or summer/autumn storm scenery. At the bottom of the artwork one can see a forest with many dark greenish trees.

The greenish shade gives a fresh feeling to the painting. The trees in the forest still have leaves on them, so the autumn might be summer, after a rain or storm, as the sky is dark.

Someo of the clouds have more white.
